# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints their name to the screen?

    #
    # print(" Hello," + name + "!")


# 2. Write a a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.

# print("Hey tell me a base and a High!")
# base = input()
# height = input()
# print(base, height)

# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.

    # print("Hello what is a radius of a circle?")
    #
    # radius = int(input()) #this will change the string into a int
    #
    # print (2 * 3.14 * radius)


# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.

    # integer = int(input('Hello! give me an integer!'))
    #
    # print(integer**.5)

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma.
