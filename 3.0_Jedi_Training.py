# Sign your name: Ryan Mullins
# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.


# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.


# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.


# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.


# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
